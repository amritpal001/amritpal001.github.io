                        <p>Encouraging the participants and other professionals to engage to implement environmental awareness through the use of arts and crafts. It is important because it teaches us how to create plant pots on recyclable materials and it also aims to preserve/maintain a good environment. <br><br>
                        Today we are facing environmental issues like pollution; there’s pollution on air, land masses, and water surfaces. According to a study, garbage dumped in the ocean is roughly at 14 billion pounds and the most major constituent is plastics. Imagine those marine lifes and dolphins! It’s truly saddening. We make 300 million of plastics a year and only just 9% of it is recycled since it’s thrown anywhere and everywhere! Instead of throwing away plastics after it’s used, why not put it into good use? <br><br> This is where our group came up with turning recyclable plastics/materials into plant pots to spread environmental awareness. When our workshop is spread, people start to wonder why we use plastics to put plants on and not just buy those ordinary plant pots? They will get curious and search for why, then they will come up with the answer ‘because our environment is worsening and we need to contribute to help the environment since we are one of the factors this is happening’. We can help not just the ocean and the marine lifes, even the plants to spread green to deforest lands and we can also lessen the production of plastics by factories and lessen pollution in the air.</p>

This really helps us know what to improve on in our workshop and possibly add the suggestions he gave. This will really benefit us in our workshop in the future. All of our participants are students and also love the idea of our workshop. And their answers are what we are looking for in our target audience but we hope that they also said the things what we need to improve in our workshop so it will help us create more ideas and add it in our workshop.</p>
